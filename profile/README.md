## Repo standards
Each repository follows:
1. `README.md` — summary, affected product/version, CVE (if assigned), exposure level (public/private).
2. `reports/` — markdown reports with diff & evidence.
3. `poc/` — PoC scripts with `README_SAFE.md` explaining isolation steps.

## Disclosure & Responsible Use
- 모든 PoC는 **격리 환경**(air-gapped / VM / container)에서만 실행해야 합니다.  
- 무단 테스트 금지. 내부 정책에 따라 공개/비공개 여부 결정.
